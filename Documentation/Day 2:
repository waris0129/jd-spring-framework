Day 2: Container and Dependency Injection

    review : Spring IoC : Inversion of Control
                        - trasnfer object very conveniently
                        - no worry about object creation
                        - gave create object responsibility to framework

    Coupling subject :
                - tightly coupled : object creation is hightly replying on dependencies
                - lossly coupled : object creation is less relying on dependencies


    format structure :
        Pojo application class --> configuration --> spring container --> complete configured



    types of spring Container
        there are twp types:
            - BeanFactory interface
            - ApplicationContext interface


    each interface have own implementation methods.


    Spring Bean is Java Object.
    Spring bean is an object created and managed by Container


    Configuration:
        - XML Configuration
        - Java Annotations
        - Java Source Code (mian gaol)


    XML Configuration :
        <bean id="objectName" class="objectClassPath" />
        Attribute:
        id and class are Attribute for bean.

    Loading the spring configuraton file
    ApplicationContext container = new ClassPathXMLAppliationContext("config.xml");

    Mentor mentor = container.getBean("objectName", Mentor.class);

    mentor.doSomething(); // implementation--> abstract method
